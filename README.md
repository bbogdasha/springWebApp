# Spring Web

This site is a collection of culinary recipes, with the ability to view recipes, create, delete and administer, register and login. The site has access restrictions for a 
visitor, for an authorized user and full administrator rights. A database is connected to the site, which stores information about the user (usr), recipes (recipes) and 
roles of each user (user_role). For convenience, the result of the work is demonstrated in three videos on YouTube.

**2. User** 
The visitor can create an account on the site. The registration process checks the correctness of the entered data:
- [x] Must start with a capital letter followed by one or more lowercase letters.
- [x] Must be minimum 8 characters, at least one letter and one number.

After registration, the user must log in and after that it becomes possible to create new recipes. When creating a new recipe, the user did not select a photo for the recipe - the default picture was set.

The user has his own page, where all his recipes are displayed, where the user can delete them.

- [x] editing user roles
